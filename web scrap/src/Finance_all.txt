FNCE717 - FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES 
(Course Syllabus)
  This course covers one of the most exciting yet fundamental areas in finance: derivative securities. Financial derivatives can be the most challenging and exotic securities traded by institutional specialists, while at the same time, they can also be the basic securities commonly traded by retail investors such as S&P Index Options, Beyond trading, the basic ideas of financial derivatives serve as building blocks to understand a much broader class of financial problems, such as complex asset portfolios, strategic corporate decisions, and stages in venture capital investing. The main objective of this course is to help students gain the intuition and skills on (1) pricing and hedging of derivative securities, and (2) using derivatives for investment and risk management. In terms of methodologies, we apply the non-arbitrage principle and the law of one price to dynamic models through three different approaches: the binomial tree model, the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, and the simulation-based risk neutral pricing approach. We discuss a wide range   of applications, including the use of derivatives in asset management, the valuation of corporate securities such as stocks and corporate bonds with embedded options, interest rate derivatives, credit derivatives, as well as crude oil derivatives. In addition to theoretical discussions, we also emphasize practical considerations of implementing strategies using derivatives as tools, especially when no-arbitrage conditions do not hold. In addition to prerequisites, STAT 613 may be taken concurrently.

FNCE801 - ADVANCED TOPICS IN PE
  (Formerly FNCE 884) This course will address a variety of applied topics in private equity (PE), with a focus on growth and later-stage buyout transactions (venture capital is not explicitly addressed in this course), and a primarily U.S.-centric view that should be largely applicable in other markets. In addition, the course will focus on the transaction stage of PE investing i.e., the art of the deal and mostly leave aside deal sourcing, portfolio management and investor relations. The goal of this course is to educate students about the substance, process and mechanics of PE investing, through the lens of the investment professionals, counterparties and advisors that drive transactions to completion. Course topics will address the entire deal process, and will include the following: Commercial Diligence (incl. financial modeling); Debt Financing; Accounting Diligence; Sales & Purchase Agreements; Comps Analysis; and Other Advisory Work. Throughout the course, students will learn about each element of the deal process through in-class lectures, while concurrently apply those learnings to a real-time mock deal, and preparing deal materials that mirror a real private equity transaction. The in-class lectures will cover both conceptual frameworks and real-world examples. 
Prerequisites: FNCE 611 AND (FNCE 726 OR FNCE 751) 
FNCE803 - BEHAVIORAL FINANCE
  (Formerly FNCE 739) There is an abundance of evidence suggesting that the standard economic paradigm - rational agents in an efficient market - does not adequately describe behavior in financial markets. In this course, we will survey the evidence and use psychology to guide alternative theories of financial markets. Along the way, we will address the standard argument that smart, profit-seeing agents can correct any distortions caused by irrational investors. Further, we will examine more closely the preferences and trading decisions of individual investors. We will argue that their systematic biases can aggregate into observed market inefficiencies. The second half of the course extends the analysis to corporate decision making. We then explore the evidence for both views in the context of capital structure, investment, dividend, and merger decisions. In addition to prerequisites, FNCE 720 and FNCE 726 are recommended but not required. 
Prerequisites: FNCE 611 
FNCE811 - ASP INFRASTRUCTURE INVES 
(Course Syllabus)
  The world economy runs on the infrastructure which has been built over the past10,000 years. Each year, this infrastructure requires updating and new additions, from roads and bridges (the original infrastructure), to railroads, airports (the more recent infrastructure), to telecommications and solar and wind power installations (modern infrastructure). There is a vast amount of public (i.e., taxpayer money directed by government officials) and private (i.e., individuals' money typically managed on their behalf and directed by private equity or banks into infrastructure investments). In this course, we will cover Infrastucture Financing and investing from various angles. We will provide descriptions of types of infrastructure, examine the financing needs of infrastructure projects, consider the historic role of government and non-government funding, and assess the changing needs of consumers and role of technology and the increasing demands posed by a globalizing economy. As private equity firms continue to build infrastructure funds, the need for, and role for, private money continues to evolve, so we will also examine infrastructure investing as a alternative asset class from the investors' perspective. FNCE 728 is recommended but not required. 
Prerequisites: FNCE 611 
FNCE812 - FNCE ECON LAW FISCAL CR 
(Course Syllabus)
  The focus will be on the causes of fiscal crises, a careful detailing of who wins and who loses, and then on how such crises might be resolved and, perhaps most importantly, how they might be prevented in the future. The course will draw upon the fiscal experiences of US local governments (New York, Philadelphia, Detroit, Orange County, Puerto Rico), utilities (WPPSS) and states (Illinois), and the international experience from such countries as Greece, Brazil, and Argentina. The costs of such crises for citizens, pensioners, and bond holders can be significant. We seek to understand the underlying economic, political, and legal/regulatory causes of such events so that they may be prevented in the future. The importance of private information and public regulation for disciplining the fiscal performance of democratically elected governments will be a central concern. We believe strongly that diagnosing and treating the "disease" of fiscal mismanagement is an interdisciplinary endeavor drawing on finance, economics, political science, and the law. Students with backgrounds in any of these disciplines are welcome. 
FNCE841 - ASP DISTRESSED INVESTING 
(Course Syllabus)
  This course familiarizes students with financial, strategic and legal issues associated with the restructuring of financally distressed firms and investment in distressed securities. The objective is to give students the concepts and tools necessary to assess the often-complex situation facing a firm facing financial distress. The participants will gain a basic understanding of the various options available for distressed firms, such as out-of-court workouts, exchange offers, prepackaged and pre-negotiated, bankruptcies, distressed asset sales, 363 auctions, and Chapter 11 reorganization. We will explore the difference between economic and financial distress, and the implications for the restructuring process. Finally, we will consider distressed debt as an asset class and develop techniques for investing in distressed securities. We will approach the investment opportunities using the concepts of value investing, in which we sharply distinguish the value of an asset from its price (as Warren Buffet explains, "Price is what you pay, value is what you get") Students will sharpen their conceptual knowledge of finance and valuation in order to properly estimate the value of a distressed firm, and then supplement that with the complexities of valuing specific securities with the capital structure.

Link to application: https://forms.gle/8nsGPBV6rCMAF1of9.
FINANCE 201.  Finance.  3 Units.

This course covers the foundations of finance with an emphasis on applications that are vital for corporate managers. We will discuss many of the major financial decisions made by corporate managers, both within the firm and in their interactions with investors. Essential in most of these decisions is the process of valuation, which will be an important emphasis of the course. Topics include criteria for making investment decisions, valuation of financial assets and liabilities, relationships between risk and return, capital structure choice, payout policy, the use and valuation of derivative securities, and risk management. This course is targeted to those students who are new to finance and for those with little quantitative background.
FINANCE 204.  Finance - Accelerated.  3 Units.

This course covers the foundations of finance with an emphasis on applications that are vital for corporate managers. We will discuss many of the major financial decisions made by corporate managers, both within the firm and in their interactions with investors. Essential in most of these decisions is the process of valuation, which will be an important emphasis of the course. Topics include criteria for making investment decisions, valuation of financial assets and liabilities, relationships between risk and return, capital structure choice, the use and valuation of derivative securities (e.g., options and convertible securities), and risk management.No previous background in finance is required or expected, but in comparison with FINANCE 201, less time will be spent in class on the steps involved in solving basic problems. Therefore, students choosing this course should be relatively comfortable with basic mathematical operations (e.g., expressions involving multiplication of multiple terms, summation of multiple terms, etc.), though familiarity with the underlying finance concepts is not expected. A good diagnostic is to skim Section 4.2 "Rules for Time Travel" (pp. 98-104) in the course textbook, Corporate Finance by Berk and DeMarzo. If you are comfortable with the level of basic mathematics involved (even if the concepts are new), 204 is a good choice. If not, you should consider FINANCE 201.
FINANCE 205.  Accelerated Managerial Finance.  3 Units.

This course covers the foundations of finance with an emphasis on applications that are vital for corporate managers. We will discuss many of the major financial decisions made by corporate managers, both within the firm and in their interactions with investors.

FINANCE 326.  Derivative Securities.  4 Units.

This course is an introduction to options, futures and other derivative securities. The goal is to learn a core set of principles that underlie the pricing and use of derivatives. In particular, we will cover the valuation and use, both for risk management and for speculation, of forwards, futures, swaps, and options; the Black-Scholes option-pricing formula; delta-hedging; credit derivatives; financial risk management; and the role of derivatives in the recent financial crisis.
FINANCE 327.  Financial Markets.  4 Units.

The aim of this course is to develop a thorough understanding of financial markets. We explore how investors make decisions about risk and return, how financial markets price risky assets in equilibrium, and how financial markets can sometimes malfunction. The course puts particular emphasis on the role of real-world imperfections that are absent from the standard textbook view of financial markets. For example, we explore the role of illiquidity: Why are there liquid markets for some types of assets but not for others? Why does liquidity often disappear in times of market turmoil? We will also study recent insights from behavioral finance about investor psychology and market inefficiencies. Moreover, we will look at financial innovations such as credit-default swaps, securitization, and hedge funds that play important roles in financial markets these days. We use cases to develop these topics in the context of practical decision-problems in the areas of asset allocation, risk management, and financing.
FINANCE 329.  Investment Seminar.  3 Units.

See FINANCE 321 course description.
FINANCE 331.  Practical Corporate Finance.  4 Units.

(Note: this course was formerly known as FIN 230) The main aim of this course is to enable students to apply the fundamental ideas of finance to problems in the area of corporate finance with all the complexities the real world entails. The course is a follow-up to the Fall Managerial Finance course where students learnt basics of valuation tecyhniques and various finance applications. We will explore both how to make all this knowledge practical as well as how to deepen our knowledge of fundamental finance ideas. nnnThe main focus of this course is on the corporate financial manager and how he/she reaches decisions as to investments, dividends and financing of all sorts. Topics include leveraged buyouts, hostile takeovers, private equity financing and venture capital, financial distress and bankruptcy, mergers and acquisitions, managing working capital. The cases will be used to motivate our discussion of how to bridge the gap between rigorous finance theory and its application to practical problems in corporate finance.nnnThe course is case-based and more advanced than FINANCE 324. "Advanced" means that we will discuss a lot of subtle qualitative issues as well as explore deeper fundamental applications of core finance ideas. The course is intensive and will require students to prepare carefully all cases, read and understand a lot of materials, and actively participate in the class discussion. The main teaching method is cold calling.
Same as: Accelerated
FINANCE 332.  Finance and Society.  3 Units.

This interdisciplinary course explores the economic, political, and behavioral forces that shape the financial system and, through this system, have a major impact on the economy and society. You will gain an in-depth understanding of how the complex interactions between individuals, corporations, governments, and the media can help markets work or, in turn, generate governance failures and inefficiencies. Visitors with varied experiences will enrich our discussions of key questions about the workings of capitalism in liberal democracies.
FINANCE 335.  Corporate Valuation, Governance and Behavior.  4 Units.

This course will develop a detailed knowledge of corporate valuation techniques, together with an understanding of the role such valuations play in a wide range of corporate financing decisions. First, the course will carefully consider different valuation techniques, the assumptions that underlie each of these methods, how they are applied in practice, how they are related to one another, and how to decide which method of valuation is appropriate for a given application. After developing these tools, they will then be applied to a wide range of corporate finance settings. Among the applications to be considered are mergers and acquisitions, international valuation, corporate governance, financial distress, agency conflicts, asymmetric information, and overvaluation. For all of these applications, this course will emphasize the central importance of valuation to understanding observed phenomena and to guiding optimal decision making, as well as the unique challenges to valuation posed by the particular application.
FINANCE 336.  The Finance of Retirement and Pensions.  4 Units.

The financial economics of how retirement is financed, particularly in the US. Topics: basic finance concepts necessary for understanding individual retirement savings. Properties of financial instruments such as bonds and stocks. Optimization of individual retirement account or 401(k) portfolios. Defined benefit pensions. Measuring defined benefit pension liabilities. Impact of defined benefit pension liabilities on corporate, state, and local budgeting. The economics of national retirement policy including Social Security and government treatment of private retirement savings.
FINANCE 341.  Modeling for Investment Management.  3 Units.

This course will combine practical and up-to-date investment theory with modeling applications. Understanding beautiful theory, without the ability to apply it, is essentially useless. Conversely, creating state-of-the-art spreadsheets that apply incorrect theory is a waste of time. Here, we try to explicitly combine theory and application. The course will be divided into 6 modules, or topics. The first day of each module will be a lecture on an investment topic. Also provided is a team modeling project on the topic. The second day of each module will be a lab. The lab day will begin with modeling concepts (tips) designed to help you use Excel to implement the module's investment topic. After the tips are provided, the remainder of the lab day is devoted to teams working on their modeling project and allowing for Q&A. On the third day of each module will be presentations and wrap-up.
FINANCE 345.  History of Financial Crises.  3 Units.

Financial crises are as old as financial markets themselves. There are many similarities between historical events. The crisis of 2008, for example, is far from unique. More often than not financial crises are the result of bubbles in certain asset classes or can be linked to a specific form of financial innovation. This course gives an overview of the history of financial crises, asset price bubbles, banking collapses and debt crises. We start with the Tulip mania in 1636 and end with the recent Euro crisis. The purpose of the course is to understand the causes of past crises and to develop a conceptual framework that ties common elements together. We will discuss the lessons that we can draw for financial markets today.
FINANCE 346.  Institutional Money Management.  3 Units.

The object of this course is to study the money management industry from the perspective of the user --- an investor who wants to invest money. This course will study the main components of the money management industry: mutual funds, hedge funds, private equity funds and venture capital funds. It will also examine important users of the industry such as non profits, endowments and defined benefit pension funds. The emphasis of the course will not be on how fund managers make money, but rather on how the industry is organized, how managerial skill is assessed, how compensation is determined, and how economic rents are divided between managers and investors. The course will explore how competitive market forces interact with managerial skill and other market frictions to give rise to the observed organization of the industry.
FINANCE 347.  Money and Banking.  3 Units.

This course is designed to help students understand the connections between money (the Federal Reserve), financial markets, and the macroeconomy. How are interest rates determined, and how does the Federal Reserve conduct monetary policy? How do Federal Reserve actions impact the US as well as other economies? What economic factors drive the yield curves in different bond markets? We will pay particular attention to the banking system, with an eye toward understanding the function, valuation, and regulation of banks. We touch on a number of topics including the role of the Federal Reserve as a lender of last resort during financial crises, unconventional monetary policy tools such as quantitative easing and forward guidance, cryptocurrency, and emerging market financial crises. We will often begin class with a discussion of current macro-financial market events in the context of our course coverage.
FINANCE 350.  Corporate Financial Modeling.  4 Units.

This course will expose students to the fundamentals, best practices, and advanced techniques of corporate financial modeling. We begin with basic operating and integrated financial statement models, and ultimately develop financial models to analyze major corporate transactions, including venture capital funding, mergers and acquisitions, and leverage buyouts. We will integrate theories presented throughout the MBA core, particularly those from accounting and finance, and take a hands-on approach to understand how the theory is implemented in practice.The focus of the course will be on developing critical financial modeling skills, understanding best practices, and recognizing common pitfalls. Students will work on a series of cases and build models that can be used for earnings and pro-forma financial statement forecasts, valuation, the assessment of financing needs, merger analysis, and LBO evaluation.Students will also gain experience presenting financial models and critically assessing them. By the conclusion of the course, students will develop the skills to construct complex financial models and the logical frameworks to utilize them for various organizational applications.
FINANCE 351.  Advanced Corporate Financial Modeling.  4 Units.

Students will engage in the development of corporate financial modeling cases and solutions. Students will also develop materials to aid others in building financial models, and serve as case leaders during lab workshops. Extensive background in financial modeling and experience with Excel is required.
FINANCE 361.  Behavioral Finance.  4 Units.

This course provides an introduction to behavioral finance, a discipline which integrates insights from psychology into the study of financial decisions and markets. There will be a focus on understanding the psychological underpinnings of financial decision-making as well as the institutional frictions that may allow these psychological mechanisms to influence economic outcomes. Applications include the pricing of assets relative to fundamental value, trading strategies, managerial behavior, and household savings and investment decisions. Conceptual issues will be emphasized through a mix of case discussions and lectures, and quantitative exercises will serve to develop analytical tools for making financial choices.
FINANCE 362.  Financial Trading Strategies.  3 Units.

The purpose of this course is to familiarize students with the different types of trading strategies employed by various money management institutions. These financial trading strategies are used to manage the risk and return profiles of specific portfolios. Throughout the sessions, students will be challenged to understand and explore the application and implementation of these different strategies. Trading simulations employed on the Rotman Interactive Trader and Rotman Portfolio Manager (using real market data and computer generated data) will be used extensively in this course as a way to learn and test different strategies. All classes will be held in the new Real-time Analytics and Investment Lab (RAIL), located on the third floor of the Bass Building (B312). Students are expected to attend all sessions. Grades are based on in-class simulation results, class participation, and two written assignments.
FINANCE 373.  Entrepreneurial Finance.  3 Units.

This is a course about the financial decision-making process largely from the point of view of the CEO of an entrepreneurial venture, ranging from very early to very late stages. The course takes a two-pronged approach: First, we develop tools and concepts of corporate finance related to modeling, valuation, control, and investment decisions within an entrepreneurial context. Second, we use cases with firms at different stages of their life cycles from initial angel or venture capital investments through exit decisions, in order to see the issues that arise when these principles are applied in practice. In some cases we show the viewpoint of the entrepreneur and in others the perspective of the investor. After all, as an entrepreneur, one cannot negotiate effectively without understanding an investor's motivations. Conversely, an investor cannot evaluate a potential investment opportunity without appreciating the entrepreneur's perspective and incentives. Finally, we explore new developments in entrepreneurial finance such as crowdfunding and early liquidity provisions.
FINANCE 377.  China's Financial System.  3 Units.

This course is a survey of China's financial system, including its banking industry, monetary policy structure, and financial markets (bonds, derivatives, equities, foreign exchange, alternative asset management, and related markets). The goal is an integrated view of how capital, risk, and liquidity are intermediated within China and cross-border. Current trends (including liberalization of markets and financial stability) will be emphasized. Coverage will be through lectures, reading of research, including primary source documents and secondary (journalistic and analyst) commentary. There will be a range of subject-matter-expert speakers. Using our special video-technology enabled classrooms at Stanford and at the Stanford Center at PKU, this course is able to draw live speakers in Beijing and to meet jointly with students at Beijing University. Students will participate actively in class discussion, make a 5-minute (per student in each group) research presentation, and submit a 10-page term paper.
FINANCE 381.  Private Equity in Frontier Markets: Creating a New Investible Asset Class.  4 Units.

In 2001, Jim O'Neil of Goldman Sachs wrote a research note which underscored the importance of so-called Emerging Markets to a well-balanced investment portfolio. Still today, most investors have little or no investment exposure beyond North America, Europe, Japan and more recently India, China and Brazil. All of this is just beginning to change. The not yet fully formed investment category called frontier market private equity is emerging and within the next decade is likely to be an asset class of its own. Private equity investments are being made in southeast Asia, in MENA(Middle East/ North Africa), in sub-Saharan countries beyond South Africa and in Latin America. Even fund of funds are appearing across these markets. At the same time, investors face a world of diminished returns expectations in developed economies just as aging demographics and the need for continued growth, innovation and infrastructure renewal places increasing demands for payout. Suffice it to say, investors will be looking beyond traditional asset classes and geographies for sources of return. This new course is designed to expose you to the still emerging, not yet fully formed world of frontier market private equity. To set the context we will start by reviewing the fundamentals of economic growth and development globally. In addition we will discuss the fundamental concepts involved in constructing and evaluating the performance of a large scale investment portfolio. We will then review cases on the elements of the private equity cycle/process and specifically address the special demands of frontier markets in general. We will also focus on issues that are specific to various markets (e.g. Nigeria, Vietnam, etc.). Students taking the course will be given the opportunity to make important contributions to the knowledge base of this still very young field by working in small teams to research topics of personal and general interest, the results of which will be reported to the rest of the class. This course will not be offered next academic year, 2017-2018.
FINANCE 385.  Angel and Venture Capital Financing for Entrepreneurs and Investors.  3 Units.

This course covers all the stages of funding for early stage high-growth companies, from seed funding to venture capital rounds to a successful exit. We will concentrate on how entrepreneurs and investors make and should make important decisions. Examples of issues that we will cover are: How can entrepreneurs raise funding successfully? What are typical mistakes entrepreneurs make in raising capital and negotiating with investors? How to choose your investor? How to pitch to an investor? How do angels and VCs generate and process their deal flow and select companies? How are VCs involved in business decisions such as recruiting talent and replacing CEOs? What are the important provisions of financial contracts between VCs and founders? How to value early-stage companies? The course is very applied and mostly case-based. We will discuss a lot of nitty-gritty details that is a must for founders and investors. Case protagonists, founders, angels, and VCs will be among guest speakers. No prior knowledge of the VC industry is needed.
FINANCE 548.  The Political Economy of Banking Regulation in US and Europe.  1 Unit.

The 2007-09 financial crisis exposed the extreme fragility of the financial system and the harm financial crises can cause. Have regulatory reforms in the US and Europe been effective and, if not, how and why? Does it matter if some institutions are "too big to fail," and, if so, how and why? This course will discuss the economic and political forces that are shaping the financial system in US and Europe and evaluate recent and current events that will have important implications for the economy for many years. We will see how politics trumps economics in Washington, London and Brussels in different but broadly predictable ways.
FINANCE 555.  Private Wealth Management and Personal Investing.  2 Units.

The Private Wealth Management and Personal Investing course will address issues that relate to the management of personal assets as opposed to institutional investing. Many investment courses at the GSB emphasize large institutional portfolios but this course is about portfolio decisions for individuals. It will cover the origins and growth of private wealth management as an industry, investment planning, risk management, inter-generational transfers of wealth, choice of wealth advisors and philanthropy. Special emphasis is on understanding how wealth managers may be evaluated, including potential conflicts of interest, and performance measurement. Classes will focus on case studies and various readings. Each class will include visits from professionals in the wealth management and personal investing business. Active class participation and a group project are required.
FINANCE 559.  The World of Investing.  1 Unit.

This course is a speaker series, exposing students to the world of first-class investors and their philosophies. Each week will have a different visitor describing their investment strategy and experience. Attendance at all sessions is a requirement to pass the course.
FINANCE 562.  Financial Trading Strategies.  2 Units.

The purpose of this course is to familiarize students with the different types of trading strategies employed by various money management institutions. These financial trading strategies are used to manage the risk and return profiles of specific portfolios. Throughout the sessions, students will be challenged to understand and explore the application and implementation of these different strategies. Trading simulations employed on the Rotman Interactive Trader and Rotman Portfolio Manager (using real market data and computer generated data) will be used extensively in this course as a way to learn and test different strategies. All classes will be held in the new Real-time Analytics and Investment Lab (RAIL), located on the third floor of the Bass Building (B312). Students are expected to attend all sessions. Graded are based on in-class simulation results, class participation, and two written assignments. This course is designed to have a fast learning curve and is a pre-requisite for FIN563, the advanced extension of this course.
FINANCE 563.  Financial Trading Strategies 2.  2 Units.

This course is an extension of FIN562, Financial Trading Strategies. Students will expand on introductory topics from the Financial Trading Strategies Course and be required to build extensive live-market models and risk management models. Class discussions will closely link current market events and pricing anomalies to theoretical and simulated markets and we will closely study the deviations between them.
FINANCE 587.  Private Equity - An Overview of the Industry.  2 Units.

This 2-unit elective at the GSB is an "Overview" of the private equity industry including its reason for being, its growth and the various strategies for success that private equity firms employ. The course looks at all aspects of private equity partnerships and private equity investing. The course may be of particular interest to five groups of students: (i) students who aspire to be employed in private equity as a career; (ii) students who plan to be employed by companies that are owned by private equity firms; (iii) students who may invest in private equity partnerships as a limited partner; (iv) students who find private equity to be an interesting part of the financial services industry, and (v) students who expect to participate in corporate business development or mergers and acquisitions. The course will meet for nine classes. Each class will have at least one senior partner from a private equity firm to comment on the activities of his firm. In years past, some of the true leaders of the industry have participated. One class will be a mock investment review committee presentation as a final project.
FINANCE 620.  Financial Markets I.  3 Units.

This course is an introductory PhD level course in financial economics. We begin with individual choice under uncertainty, then move on to equilibrium models, the stochastic discount factor methodology, and no-arbitrage pricing. We will also address some empirical puzzles relating to asset markets, and explore the models that have been developed to try to explain them.
FINANCE 621.  Financial Markets II.  3 Units.

This course continues F620 and covers a number of main concepts in market microstructure. Among the topics that are covered are (i) Rational Expectations models and their foundations (ii) strategic trading models (iii) models of market and funding liquidity. In addition to the discussion of theoretic models time will be allotted to empirical applications.
FINANCE 622.  Dynamic Asset Pricing Theory.  4 Units.

This course is an introduction to multiperiod models in finance, mainly pertaining to optimal portfolio choice and asset pricing. The course begins with discrete-time models for portfolio choice and security prices, and then moves to a continuous-time setting. The topics then covered include advanced derivative pricing models, models of the term structure of interest rates, the valuation of corporate securities, portfolio choice in continuous-time settings, and finally general-equilibrium and over-the-counter asset pricing models. Students should have had some previous exposure to general equilibrium theory and some basic courses in investments. Strong backgrounds in calculus, linear algebra, and probability theory are recommended. Problem assignments are frequent and, for most students, demanding. Prerequisite: F620 and MGTECON600 (or equivalent), or permission of instructor.
FINANCE 624.  Corporate Finance Theory.  4 Units.

This course considers a wide range of topics in theoretical corporate finance (broadly interpreted). Topics include capital structure decisions, agency conflicts in the firm, dividend policy, security design, optimal financial contracting, the theory of the firm, the market for corporate control, and banking and financial intermediation, among others. The primary focus is on how asymmetric information, agency conflicts, strategic interactions, and incomplete contracting affect corporate financial decision-making. The course aims both to familiarize students with influential papers and current research, and to promote new research ideas in the area.
FINANCE 625.  Empirical Asset Pricing.  3 Units.

This course is an introduction to empirical research in asset pricing. The focus of the course is on the interplay between financial economic theory, econometric method, and that analysis of financial market data. Topics include tests of asset pricing models, return predictability in time-series and cross-section, empirical studies of asset market imperfections, and studies of individual and professional investor behavior. Class discussions will draw on textbooks/monographs and original articles and working papers.
FINANCE 626.  Advanced Corporate Finance.  3 Units.

This is a course on contemporary theoretical and empirical issues in corporate finance. Building upon the first-year courses in corporate finance theory and empirical methods in finance, we will examine issues in asset pricing applications to corporate finance, dynamic capital structure (dynamic financing decisions), financial distress, financing and investment interactions, and behavioral corporate finance. Both conceptual economic frameworks and econometric methods will be developed as needed. A requirement for this course is that students complete two written projects, one theoretical and one empirical, and at least one of these projects will be presented to the class.
FINANCE 627.  Venture Capital and Finance of Innovation.  3 Units.

In this course we will study the theory and empirics of venture capital (VC) and, more broadly, finance of innovation. We will start by reviewing the way the VC and related markets function and then will dive into such topics as VC contracting, valuation, and impact on innovation. We will review most important research studies published in the field over the past 20+ years and pay particular attention to recent research.
FINANCE 628.  Finance Pre-Seminar Reading Course.  1 Unit.

Finance Pre-Seminar Reading.
FINANCE 630.  Empirical Corporate Finance.  3 Units.

This course provides an introduction to empirical research in corporate finance, with an emphasis on the application of cross-sectional and panel data econometric techniques for causal inference. Topics include investment policy, entrepreneurship and innovation, financing decisions, firm ownership, corporate governance, managerial incentives, financial contracting, and the structure and internal organization of firms. The course assumes knowledge of econometrics at the level of MGTECON 603.
FINANCE 632.  Empirical International Finance.  3 Units.

This is an advanced graduate-level course in international finance and macroeconomics. The course focuses on empirical methods, stylized facts, new advances in large-scale empirical work, and applied theory. This course is targeted to advanced second year PhD students. The course assumes familiarity with the basics of graduate-level macroeconomics and finance. Students without the necessary familiarity with these techniques are welcome to take the course, but should expect to have to fill the gaps on their own (and with the help of their classmates!). Given the target audience above, the course has three main objectives. 1) To introduce and investigate both classic and new economic issues at the frontier of current research in international finance and macroeconomics. The purely pedagogical part of the course aims to make students familiar with the questions, the current state of research, and the empirical tools currently being used. 2) To create a mental framework and intuitive understanding of important and active questions. What makes a question interesting? What makes a paper a good paper? How to develop a reasoned view of new (and perhaps yet un-studied) issues in international finance and macroeconomics? This objective is less direct and less formal, but aims to transition the students into full-time researchers. 3) To kick-start students on independent research. For those interested in applied work the course makes you familiar and tries to connect you with existing data at the frontier of the field, both public and proprietary. For those interested in theoretical work the course staff acts as a sounding board for early research ideas.
FINANCE 633.  Advanced Empirical Corporate, Banking and Household Finance.  3 Units.

entrepreneurial finance and private equity (34101)


course evaluations  







course description by faculty



  kaplan, steven meadow, scott zwick, erickaplan, steven contentthis course uses the case method to study entrepreneurial and private equity finance. the course is motivated by increases in both the supply of and demand for private equity. on the supply side, the amount of private equity under management - by partnerships investing in venture capital, growth equity, leveraged buyouts, distressed companies, etc. - has increased substantially in the last two decades. on the demand side, a large number of mbas and others are interested in starting and managing their own businesses. private equity also has grown substantially outside of the u.s.the primary objective of the course is to provide an understanding of the concepts and institutions involved in entrepreneurial finance and private equity markets. to do this, the course has been designed to be broad and comprehensive. we will explore private equity from a number of perspectives, beginning with the entrepreneur/issuer, moving to private equity - venture capital and leveraged buyout - partnerships, and finishing with investors in private equity partnerships. for each class meeting, study questions will be assigned concerning a case study. we will discuss these questions and the material in the case for most of the class period. before each case discussion, each student will be required to submit a memorandum (up to two pages) of analysis and recommendations. group work is encouraged, but not required on these short memoranda. memoranda with up to three names on them are acceptable. we will use journal articles and some lectures to supplement and enhance the case discussions. all required cases and supplementary readings will be posted online in canvas.preassignment: students are responsible for a memorandum for each case we discuss in the first class. the first class assignment is detailed in canvas. all students (including those who are not registered, but are trying to add the course) must

part of an entrepreneurial enterprise or evaluating such enterprises from the seat of the public or private financier.the chief objective of the course is to provide an understanding of the criteria for a successful entrepreneurial endeavor and the methods of analysis to make the proper judgment.  the casework will consider ventures representing broad sectors of the economy, including telecommunications, healthcare and consumer services.  these sectors will be used to examine entrepreneurial activity and analysis.  the impact of the internet / social media as an enhancement to these sectors will be interwoven throughout.the class analyzes the role of various functional areas e.g., finance, marketing, and strategy, toward achieving success in new ventures.daily discussions will cover issues of private equity finance from seed stage through growth equity to recapitalization.  deal structure, incentive design, risk-based valuation, financial management in private, rapidly growing enterprises will be included.  exit strategies will be covered, including initial public offerings, mergers and strategic partnerships.  restructuring poorly performing projects will also be a component.attention is also given to analyzing the suppliers of capital, individual investors, venture capitalists, commercial banks, asset-based lenders and investment banks.before each class, students will be required to submit an executive summary that includes analysis and recommendations.  group work is encouraged, but not required on these executive summaries.  memoranda with up to five team member names on them are acceptable.  we will discuss the study questions and the material in each class period.preassignment: students are responsible for a memorandum for each case we

private capital markets and in the perceived importance of high growth entrepreneurial projects.

the primary goal of the course is to familiarize students with the financial and organizational challenges typical of start-up and growing private companies and to provide an understanding of the concepts and institutions involved in private capital markets. to do this, the course is broad and comprehensive. the course will appeal to students who want to start and manage their own business, who want to work in a start-up, or who want to work in a venture capital or private equity
organization.

the course primarily considers the financial economics of entrepreneurial settings, but discussions will also integrate issues from micro and macroeconomics, strategy, organization, and control. we explore the questions raised from many perspectives, often contrasting the positions of entrepreneurs, issuers, and targets with those of managing and limited partners. issues covered include deal structure, incentive design, valuation of high risk projects, financial management in rapidly growing firms, initial public offerings, mergers and acquisitions, and capital restructuring.  among capital suppliers we consider informal risk capital, commercial banks, angel investors, venture capital firms, and investment banks.formatlecturesdiscussioncase studiesgroup projectsprerequisitesbusiness 33001 (or 33002), 35000 (or 35901), and 35200: strict. business 30130 would be helpful.materialswe will use journal articles, some lectures, and visiting speakers to suppl

introductory finance (35001)

course description by faculty



  bhattacharya, ayanbhattacharya, ayan contentthis course provides an introduction to the field of finance and is intended for students who do not plan to work in the finance area but wish to be conversant with the important ideas and tools of the field which they might encounter in the course of their careers as consultants or managers. most of what one needs to know to understand finance issues in a managerial position involves corporate finance, so the course emphasizes corporate finance topics over other areas. for example, the course covers the basic capital asset pricing model but does not cover several other asset-pricing models that are generally discussed in 35000. neither does the course delve into the institutional details of various assets or asset markets (such as the markets for derivatives) unless these are needed to understand corporate finance issues (for example, some understanding of bond contracts is essential to understand financing issues, or some knowledge of options is useful for valuation of projects). more specifically, aside from the necessary asset-pricing background, the course considers criteria for corporate investment decisions (capital budgeting) and provides an introduction to corporate valuation. the course also considers the firms financing decisions, namely, what securities to issue and how much to pay out in dividends. the format is primarily lecture, but class discussion is strongly encouraged. a detailed syllabus will be posted on the university's canvas web site for this course as soon as it is available.formatlecturesdiscussionprerequisitesit is strongly recommended that students take business 30000 prior to taking business 35001.materialsthe main text used for the course is berk and demarzo, corporate finance. the course canvas site will contain supplemental readings and articles.resourcescanvas site availablegradesbased on homework assignments, a mid-term, and a final. no auditors. provisional grades for non-booth students provided, but no early final grades.gradesgraded homework assignmentsassessment & testingmidtermfinal exam (in class)restrictionsno auditorssyllabus  scheduleautumn 2020section: 35001-01m 8:30am-11:30amharper centerthe sidney davidson classroom-hcc04dual modalityautumn 2020section: 35001-81m 6:00pm-9:00pmgleacher centerthe amoco lecture hall-gc300dual modalityautumn 2020section: 35001-85s 1:30pm-4:30pmlocation: tbdremote-onlydescription and/or course criteria last updated: august 4 2020

  colonnelli, emanuelecolonnelli, emanuele contentemerging markets (ems) have recently become major contributors to global economic growth as well as sources of risk and uncertainty with international ramifications.   this course offers an overview of the main issues faced by entrepreneurs and investors operating in ems, and provides specific tools that are most fitting to students who want to pursue a career in firms, or start their own business, in growth markets outside the u.s. students interested in private equity (pe) and venture capital (vc) in ems will find the class especially relevant. the first part of the course focuses on doing business in ems. we introduce the political and economic uncertainties that characterize these economies by studying the non-market factors and institutional frictions that influence private sector behavior. to succeed in ems, firms and investors must be able to assess factors such as the risks posed by weak legal systems that limit the enforceability of contracts, political instability, and corruption. the goal of this first part is not to become experts on particular countries or regions but rather to train ourselves in the use of a framework and principles that can be applied to evaluate business opportunities across many countries, markets, and sectors. in the first part of the course you will start developing a group entrepreneurship project idea of your choice. the second part of the course focuses on investing in entrepreneurs and firms in ems. we will place a strong emphasis on pe, and specifically vc and growth equity deals in ems, which are some of the fastest growing asset classes in the world. after introducing the basic concepts and frameworks in the early stage investing landscape, we will analyze several recent case studies covering deal sourcing and structuring, valuation, operational value creation, and exit strategies. we will also discuss impact investing and the role of government in financing high-growth entrepreneurship. this second part of the course ends with a final group entrepreneurship project where you will have the opportunity to develop a business plan and/or an investment thesis that could realistically be implemented in an em of your choice.formatlecturesdiscussioncase studiesgroup projectsgroup presentationsmaterialslecture notes, cases, and other required readings (articles, academic papers, book chapters) will be posted on canvas. the course description and class schedule will also be posted on canvas.resourcescanvas site availablegradesbased on class participation, cases, a midterm exam, and a final take-home case. no auditors. cannot be taken pass/fail.gradesgraded homework assignmentsgraded attendance/participationassessment & testingmidtermfinal exam (take home)restrictionsno pass/fail gradesno auditorssyllabus  schedulespring 2021section: 35213-01meeting day/time: tbdlocation: tbdspring 2021section: 35213-81meeting day/time: tbdlocation: tbdspring 2021section: 35213-85meeting day/time: tbdlocation: tbddescription and/or course criteria last updated: july 15 2020

advanced valuation --- this is a course on real options:  the use of option theory to determine the value of flexibility, patents, technological innovation, learning by doing, marketing surveys, the potential to franchise or expand operations and other issues relevant to corporate strategy.  specific applications treated in detail:  valuation of movie rights and patents, manufacturing facilities, and r&d.  the course also conducts a detailed valuation of operations like power plants and refineries whose inputs, outputs or both are traded in futures markets.  the course moves beyond black-scholes and the binomial option pricing model to various extensions required to fit real options applications.  these extensions are also used widely in the valuation of advanced financial options.  the course involves considerable spreadsheet work and shows how relatively simple spreadsheets can be used to implement the binomial option pricing model.
theoretical models in finance i --- this is the first course in a two-part sequence in theoretical models in finance, the second course being fin 872. the set of topics covered will change from year to year. potential topics across the two courses include (i) applications of asymmetric information (ii) trading and price formation and (iii) continuous time models in finance.
behavioral finance --- this course will survey developments in behavioral finance. a great deal of recent research has focused on the behavior of individual investors and how that behavior deviates from the way in which individuals have been modeled by economists. the findings are useful for individual investors who want to avoid making mistakes. they are also useful for future manages that will supervise traders and for those that would like to trade opposite the investors and biases. finally, they can be useful for students that want to develop new finance technologies that help people avoid behavioral biases. beyond covering behavioral finance, the course will discuss some strategies to succeed in a world where some traders have biases. since this course is a professional capstone course, students will be expected to engage in behavioral finance research and submit a research paper at the end of the semester.
big data in finance --- this course aims to facilitate the acquisition of skills that are useful in quantitative asset management. the course starts from basic portfolio theory and then reviews basic quantitative investment strategies (such as value, growth, momentum, and carry strategies). students then develop, back-test, and evaluate trading strategies  in a portfolio context, both in a domestic and an international context, as well as in a multi-asset framework covering equities, bonds, and commodities. finally, we cover the real-time use of non-standard data sources.
capital markets and investment strategy --- capital markets and investment strategies is a course that covers the fundamentals of making sound investment decisions using modern finance theory.  the course focuses primarily on equity securities.  our ultimate goal in the class is constructing a portfolio of equities that delivers the best possible expected return given the risk inherent in holding the portfolio.  to that end, we will discuss ideas about how to find investment opportunities, how to assess the rewards and risks of these opportunities, how best to hold these assets in a portfolio, and how to gauge the difference in returns we should expect to receive from this portfolio from those we actually earn.prior to winter 2015, this course was offered as fin 308.

capital markets and investment strategy --- this course covers portfolio analysis, asset pricing models, and investment strategies.  it uses both the lecture and the case method of instruction to develop a practical understanding of some of the more important financial instruments and markets.  security valuation and management of investment strategies are major themes present throughout the course.  a fundamental objective of the course is to enable students to gain a robust familiarity with approaches that can be adapted to analysis of broad classes of financial assets and markets.  such skills are indispensable to investment analysis in an economic environment characterized by an unprecedented amount of financial innovation, both in the creation of new securities and in the development and evolution of financial institutions.
challenges in emerging market finance: argentina as a case study --- this course will provide students with an in-depth look at finance in emerging markets through the lens of the experience of argentina. during our three weeks in country, students will review and/or learn international finance concepts and tools, with an emphasis on emerging markets. we will also learn from in-country faculty about the history and economic history of argentina. finally, we will meet with various stakeholders in the argentina economy, including corporations, financial institutions, and government officials. students will apply the tools of finance and development to problems that argentine companies face in accessing markets and obtaining finance.
introduction to commercial read estate finance --- this course is an introductory commercial real estate finance course, designed to pick up on the specific fundamentals covered in finance 320 along with applying the time value of money concepts, ratios and the discounted cash flow valuation methods from finance 300.  a new excel spreadsheet will be introduced at each class session to coincide with the text and lecture topics.  several guest speakers will complement the theoretical aspects of financing, development, and risk and return with updates on the current commercial real estate marketplace.  much of the class is interactive via case studies related to class topics.
theoretical models in finance ii --- this is the second course in a two-part sequence on theoretical models in finance, the second course being fin 865. the set of topics covered will change from year to year. potential topics across the two courses include (i) applications of asymmetric information (ii) trading and price formation and (iii) continuous time models in finance.new title/description for fall 2019 -
course title: trading and price information
course description: a vibrant research (variously labeled as financial markets, information economics and markets, or, more narrowly, market microstructure) analyzes, both theoretically and empirically, the impact of important (yet often ignored) trading frictions on the process of price formation in domestic and international financial markets (for equity, government and corporate bonds, currency, and real estate, among others). the main goal of this ph.d. course is to motivate students to pursue theoretical and empirical research in this exciting area of financial economics.

corporate finance --- the purpose of the course is to provide a background for understanding the determinants of corporate financial policy and introduce students to current research in finance.  the course complements the material in ba 855.  the boundaries of the firm, its financial structure and issues of corporate control are discussed by drawing upon theories of agency, incomplete contracting, and property rights.  we cover strategic issues in the market for corporate control, bankruptcy and reorganizations and optimal contracts as applied to the design of securities.  we will also discuss issues such as the interaction between product market competition and financial policy.
corporate financial policy --- this is an advanced corporate finance course with an emphasis on debt and equity management, security issuance, and distribution policy. topics include descriptions of types of debt and equity, tradeoffs in the choice of an optimal capital structure; the role of capital structure in competitive strategy; the design of capital structure and securities to control information problems and limit conflicts of interest between different classes of security holders; procedures and costs of issuing securities including initial public offerings, and the determinants of optimal payout policy. the course is intended for those with career objectives in financial management, the corporate finance aspects of investment banking, or general management.
corporate financial strategy --- this is the capstone course among corporate finance courses. it deals with the co-determination of financial policy and business strategy.   the course is divided in three. the first segment focuses on the issues in designing a financial strategy for companies that are growing and expanding rapidly after their ipo. the second segment studies the challenges in designing a financial strategy and a major corporate restructuring at the same time. it includes divestitures, asset sales, going private, and bankruptcy, among other strategies. the final segment focuses on business strategies that are made possible by innovative corporate financial engineering. most cases discussed are about fast growing companies, companies that face a rapidly changing environment, or companies with drastic restructuring needs.
corporate financing decisions --- this course develops the conceptual foundation for making corporate financing decisions. capital structure theory is explained in detail with an in-depth analysis of market imperfections such as taxes, cost of financial distress, agency and informational issues. the next portion of the course covers different securities used to raise external capital with an emphasis on the institutional aspects of acquiring capital (initial public offerings, seasoned equity offerings, public debt, convertible debt, private equity & venture capital). the causes and effects of financial distress and the bankruptcy process are explained. payout policy and different payout strategies (dividends versus stock repurchase) are discussed. the course ends with a brief discussion of risk management. throughout the course, financial theory will be integrated with the use of specific case studies.
corporate investment decisions --- this course focuses on analysis of corporate investment decisions. since the emphasis is on application of the concepts learnt in the core courses, the course is case-oriented. the course begins with the valuation tools of financing statement analysis, financial forecasting, and cash flow estimation and then shows how to estimate of cost of capital. the major emphasis of the course is valuation in different contexts such as resource allocation, mergers and acquisitions, and cross-border acquisitions. the course provides the student an opportunity to learn and practice spreadsheet skills. the course also provides an overview of working capital management.*prior to fall 2014, fin 415 was called fin 314.

dissertation - candidacy --- dissertation research at the candidacy stage.
dissertation - precandidacy --- dissertation research at the precandidacy stage.
dynamic models and structural estimation in corporate finance --- this course seeks to achieve three equally important goals. first, it is intended to expose students to key papers in the structural corporate finance literature. second, the course is designed to strengthen students' ability to dissect, digest, and critique academic research. third, the course is intended to introduce students to the methods used to solve and estimate the parameters of dynamic models.
empirical methodology in finance --- this seminar course will expose graduate students to the more commonly used empirical methods in financial literature.  as this is an application-oriented course, it is assumed that students have had exposure to both finance and econometrics at the graduate level.  this course will study the important applications of empirical methodology to financial problems over the past two decades.  the course will not deal with either finance or econometrics, but important applications of the latter in testing basic financial models.
energy project finance --- the energy industry is undergoing its biggest transition since the widespread adoption of electricity. a convergence of factors - global warming, new technologies, resource constraints, shifting global demographics, and unpredictable global policies - has put in motion what will be the largest industrial transition in history.

harnessing and using energy productively is enormously capital intensive. deploying capital into energy projects is complex, requiring investors to manage the diverse range of policy mechanisms, identify or develop the necessary supporting infrastructure and understand volatile markets and politics.  

the 6-week energy finance course will examine the economic drivers for energy investments and the fundamentals of financing energy projects. it will also cover traditional financial modeling tools used in the oil and gas industry, project finance models popular in the renewable energy industry, and new innovative financial mechanisms used by corporations involved in energy efficiency and demand response. every week a guest speaker from the energy industry will lead students through a new financial model used to address a real world energy issue, allowing students to fine tune their analytical tools through interaction with professionals who use these tools on a regular basis. it will include three excel based modules on modeling energy projects.the 6-week energy finance course will examine the economic drivers for energy investments and the fundamentals of financing energy projects. it will also cover traditional financial modeling tools used in the oil and gas industry, project finance models popular in the renewable energy industry, and new innovative financial mechanisms used by corporations involved in energy efficiency and demand response. every week a guest speaker from the energy industry will lead students through a new financial model used to address a real world energy issue, allowing students to fine tune their analytical tools through interaction with professionals who use these tools on a regular basis. it will include three excel based modules on modeling energy projects.

entrepreneurial finance --- this course is open to all bba students and presents the fundamentals of venture capital and private equity finance.  it is focused on financing startup and early stage, technology-based firms, later stage investment and buyouts.  the course covers venture capital and private equity market structure and institutional arrangements and the application of financial theory and methods in a venture capital and private equity setting.  four main aspects of venture capital and private equity are covered:  valuation, deal structuring, governance, and harvesting.  "live" case studies are used in demonstrate the practical, hands-on application of techniques following their development in class.prior to winter 2015, this course was offered as fin 325.

finance and the sustainable enterprise --- this course deals with unique financial valuation and management issues faced by a sustainable business.  we will study the efficacy of traditional and modern financial methods in enabling corporations to develop and implement sustainable strategies.
financial analysis --- this course is primarily devoted to fundamentals of financial analysis as applied to both corporate finance and financial markets.  on the corporate side, the course deals with capital budgeting in great detail.  capital budgeting criteria (npv, irr) and cash flow estimation are discussed. the concept of risk is then introduced and the capm is used to derive cost of equity and then, the weighted average cost of capital. the course also provides as introductory treatment of the effects of financing on capital budgeting decisions.  on the financial markets side, the course introduces the student to the concepts of competitive capital markets and market efficiency. the workings of the financial markets are explored using the trading room. the principles of equity valuation are also covered. finally, term structure and bond valuation are discussed.
financial derivatives in corporate finance:  managing risk and creating value --- financial derivatives play several important role in corporate finance:  they can be used to hedge risks, they are the building blocks for analysis of corporate credit risk, and they serve as analytical tools to value corporate investment projects that have built-in flexibility, e.g., due to a multi-stage structure or timing options.  in this course, we introduce the core principles that underlie the valuation and use of derivatives such as futures, swaps, options, and credit derivatives.  we apply these ideas to a number of problems including hedging of interest-rate, foreign exchange, and commodity price risk, real options in investment decisions, and transfer of credit risk.  with a focus on corporate value creation, we pay particular attention to potential misuses of derivatives and unintended consequences of corporate financial engineering in the face of financial market imperfections.
financial management --- this course is an introduction to the principles of financial decision-making.  topics include (i) present value, focusing on valuation of projects and financial securities; (ii) portfolio theory and the capm, which highlight the risk-return trade-off; (iii) determining the cost of capital for a project; (iv) principles of capital structure.
